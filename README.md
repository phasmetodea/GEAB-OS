# GEAB OS
 The most epic and based OS

Gunnar's Epic And Based OS is a boot sector OS that is only 512 bytes large. And I made it with windows Notepad. 
It doesn't require a hard drive, GPU, mouse or a sound card. It is so small and light that you can run it on any x86 computer from as far back as 1978.  
It is currently in version 0.1 so it's currently a bit lacking.
